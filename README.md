## Other TODOS:
 - Making a ~~[guide](https://github.com/zegevlier/minecraft-proxy-rs/blob/main/Building%20the%20JAR.md)~~ or automated tool to put in the secret logger
 - Add tests for *all* values in packets
 - Maybe add tests for cypher.rs
 - Automated loading in of things in server and clientbound
